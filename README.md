# Simple Cache

## Deprecated with Nitrogen

This version has been deprecated with use of
[Nitrogen](https://nitrogenproject.com) in favor of
[NitroCache](https://github.com/nitrogen/nitro_cache)

This is kept here for use with the book [Build it with
Nitrogen](https://builditwithnitrogen.com).

**This current version is merely a shell around NitroCache, as mentioned above.
It uses [erlias](https://github.com/choptastic/erlias) to establish the
remapping.**

This was originally a fork of
[simple_cache](https://github.com/marcelog/simple_cache) modified specifically
for the needs of integration with the [Nitrogen Web
Framework](http://nitrogenproject.com), and is now just a shell.
